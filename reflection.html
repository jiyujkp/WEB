  <h2>Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean? </h2>
  <p>Ans : Responsive design is a graphic user interface (GUI) design strategy for creating information that adapts easily to different screen sizes. Designers use relative units (percentage) to scale items and use media queries so that their designs may automatically adjust to the browser space to maintain content uniformity across devices.
Responsive Web design entails more than merely adjusting screen dimensions and automatically resizing graphics; it entails a completely new way of thinking about design. Let's speak about all of these features, as well as some more concepts that are in the works.</p>
  <h2>How does responsive design relate to web technologies? </h2>
  <p>Ans : While responsive design evolved as a method of providing equal access to information regardless of device, it is also possible to conceal specific features on smaller devices, such as background pictures, as in the Transport for London example above, secondary content, or additional navigation. Decisions concerning concealing content and functionality or changing the appearance of different device types should be based on your understanding of your consumers and their needs. RWD has the potential to be more advantageous than creating separate sites for various device kinds. When opposed to constructing three or four independent sites, using a single codebase speeds up development and simplifies maintenance over time by requiring just one piece of code and content to be updated rather than three or four. RWD is also "future-proof," in the sense that it can support additional breakpoints at any moment. If a 5-inch or 15-inch smartphone becomes popular, the code can support the new devices. RWD doesnâ€™t tie design to a particular device.</p>
  <h2>What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your
  research?
  </h2>
  <p>Ans : While doing this assessment , I got to know few things about how web design behave differently on different devices . As all should be coded while keeping the features of device in mind. For example, length and width of devices , the OS of devices , client requirements too , security of devices and so on.</p>
  <h2>Finally, describe your learning experience in the course.</h2>
  <p>Ans : I had a great experience of desiging this web site I got to learn many things which were conceptual as well as practical. In many fields i was stuck but when i gone through all notes and basic of all topics i.e javascript, CSS , HTML I tried to solved it all . I tried my level best to fulfill all the requirements for this assessment. Professor notes and their teachings really helped me a lot. </p>
